          <h2>Get Started with HTML and CSS</h2>
          <p>To get started and program with both HTML and CSS, it is important to understand the basic frameworks of both HTML and CSS. This section will discuss the interaction between HTML and CSS in order to create a well designed page. After reading through this section, you should move on to the Beginner's Tutorial Section and put what you learned into action. </p>
          <a class="anchor" id="TextEditors"></a>
          <h2>Text Editor for HTML and CSS</h2>
          <p> To better understand and follow along in this and subsequent lessons, you should download and install a HTML and/or a CSS text editor. Two text editors that we recommend users to use are Notepad++ (for Windows) and TextWrangler (for Mac). The links to download each are below.</p>        
          <div class="col-md-6"><div class="GetStartedDownload"><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"><img class="downloadicon" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Notepad%2B%2B_Logo.png"/><br>Notepad++</a></div></div>
          <div class="col-md-6"><div class="GetStartedDownload"><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler" target="_blank"><img class="downloadicon" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcT7ERTo-tmnIMV8H7mTI5KKfmZqBP5HXZsbOhNdXuukGGxAWlmy3w"/><br>TextWrangler</a></div></div>
          <p>Once downloaded. Create a file and save the file with an extension of ".html" or ".css" depending on which you are programming. Both Notepad++ and TextWrangler will then provide color feedback for HTML and CSS.</p>
         <a class="anchor" id="MarkupStyle"></a>
		<h2>HTML is Markup and CSS is Style</h2>
		<p>
        	HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. As their names would imply, HTML is a markup language, more detailed information about HTML can be found out about by <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/">click here to visit W3C </a> which oversees the HTML language, and CSS is a style sheet language, more detailed information about CSS can be found out about by <a href="http://www.w3.org/css/">click here to visit W3C </a> which oversees the CSS language. A markup language is language that allows readers to be able to distinguish what is text and what is the annotations (or in HTMLs case, tags). Below is an example of HTML:  
            <blockquote> 
            	<p> &lt;p&gt; This is text &lt;\p&gt;</p>
          	</blockquote>
        In the example above, the "p"s are the tags where as the text in between them are the text. In a HTML document, you almost always find tags and text enclosed within the tags. In a later section, characteristics of tags will be discussed.<br><br>
        CSS is different than HTML in that it cannot function on its own as CSS is used for styling. CSS is used in conjunction with HTML. An example of CSS code is shown below:
            <blockquote> 
            	<p> p{ color: red; }</p>
          	</blockquote>
         In this example, there are three parts: selector, property and value. The selector in the example shown above is "p", the property is "color" and the value is "red. This CSS code used in conjunction with the previous example HTML code would make the "This is text" text red and subsequently every text that is wrapped in a "p" or paragraph tag. Looking at this, you may think that you do not want every "p" tag to be red, thus there needs to be a way to target certain p tags. The next section will discuss characteristics of HTML tags and how the "ID" and "Class" HTML tags allow for targeting.</p>       
         <a class="anchor" id="TagAttributes"></a>
         <h2>Attributes in HTML Tags</h2>
         <p>The characteristic of HTML tags are sometimes called HTML attributes. The most common attributes that a HTML tag might have is the "ID" or "Class" attribute. Below is an updated example of the previous HTML example with the "ID" and the "Class" attribute. 
         <blockquote> 
            	<p> &lt;p <strong>id="ExampleParagraph" class="Example"</strong>&gt; This is text &lt;\p&gt;</p>
         </blockquote>
         In the example shown above, you can see the addition to the tags. Notice that for every attribute added, there is a corresponding value associated with it. Note that there are many other attributes such as "style", "name" and "value" and depending on what the HTML page purpose is, additional tags might be needed.</p>
         <a class="anchor" id="IDClass"></a>
         <h2> ID versus Class Attributes </h2>
         <p>Looking at the example in the previous section, it is not apparent what the difference is between a ID and a Class attribute. Simply put, a ID references a specific instance of a tag and is unique per page whereas a Class can reference many tags per page or pages. Knowing this is highly important because used in conjunction with CSS, you can target specific HTML tags and customize them to will. </p>
          <a class="anchor" id="CSSIDClass"></a>
         <h2>Use ID and Class to Target in CSS</h2>
         <p>In the previous CSS example, we targeted all "p" or paragraph tags. If the tag has an ID or Class attribute within the HTML tag, we can target only a specific instance or instances of the HTML tags instead of targeting every generic "p" tag. Below is an example (based on the Example in Attributes in HTML Tags) of how to target specific instances using the ID attribute:
         <blockquote>
         	<p> #ExampleParagraph{ color: red; } </p>
         </blockquote>
		When you want to target specific instances, you need to use the "#", pound/hashtag symbol followed by the name of the ID with no spaces. This will tell CSS to target only the tag that has the specific ID. On occassion, you may want several IDs to have the same attributes. Instead of having to copying and pasting multiple instances of the CSS code, a "," can be used to target multiple different IDs. An example is shown below:
         <blockquote>
         	<p> #ExampleParagraph <strong>, #ExampleSecondParagraph</strong>{ color: red; } </p>
         </blockquote>
        Looking at this, you might think that there must be an easier way than using commas to target multiple tags. There is an easier way, it is through the use of the "class" attribute. As the ID attribute needs to be unique per page, the class id can be used multiple times over a page. Additionally, the ID tag can be used in-conjunction with the class in the event the designer wants to override the class styling. An example of CSS targeting via classes is shown below:
         <blockquote>
         	<p> .Example{ color: red; } </p>
         </blockquote>
         As seen in this example, classes are targeted with a "." as opposed to ID targeting which is a "#". Like ID targeting, multiple classes can be targeted together through the use of the ",".</p>
        <a class="anchor" id="LinkHTMLCSS"></a>
        <h2>Linking HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>
        Now that you know how HTML and CSS interact, you are probably wondering how to link HTML and CSS together. The most efficient way to do so is to have the CSS file separate from the HTML file so that the CSS file can be used multiple times. In the "head" section of your HTML file, you will need to include the following (assumming that the CSS is in the same location as the path file, otherwise the path would need to be appended before the css file):
        <blockquote>
         <p>&lt;link href="nameofcssfile.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
         </blockquote>              Now that you have an understanding of how HTML and CSS interact, you can continue to the Beginner's Tutorial to learn how to create a one-page website.
